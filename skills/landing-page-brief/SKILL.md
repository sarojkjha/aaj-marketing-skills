# Landing Page Brief

Turn an offer into a build-ready landing page spec — the sections, the message in each, the proof, and the CTAs — so a designer, developer, or page builder can execute without guessing. A good brief decides the page's job and the order of persuasion before a single pixel is placed.

## When to use

The user is about to build (or rebuild) a landing page and needs the structure and copy direction first.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context** (`.agents/product-marketing.md` / `.agents/aaj-brand.md`) and reuse the positioning if it exists; otherwise pull it from the `positioning-statement` skill.
2. **Lock the page's one job** — the single conversion goal (signup, demo, purchase, lead) — and the one audience it speaks to.
3. **Gather** the core benefit, supporting benefits, proof (data, testimonials, logos), objections to overcome, and the competitive alternative.

## Workflow

1. **Define the through-line:** the single promise the whole page makes, derived from positioning.
2. **Lay out the sections** in persuasion order using the template in `resources/brief-template.md` (hero → proof → how it works → benefits → objection handling → final CTA).
3. **Write copy direction** for each section — the message and angle, not necessarily final words — plus the specific CTA.
4. **Place proof deliberately** near the claims it supports and the points of hesitation.
5. **Add conversion + SEO/GEO notes:** one primary action, minimal form, and the page's title/meta, answer-first intro, and schema (hand to the `geo-content-optimization` skill if the page must rank/be cited).

## Present the result

Deliver the section-by-section brief (section, purpose, message/copy direction, proof, CTA), the single primary CTA, and the SEO/GEO notes — ready to hand to a builder.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **One job per page.** A page that tries to do everything converts no one.
- **Lead with the outcome**, not the feature list or the company story.
- **Match message to traffic source.** A page for a specific ad should echo that ad's promise.
- **Don't bury proof.** Put it where doubt arises, not only at the bottom.
- **Minimize the ask.** Every extra field and every secondary CTA costs conversion.
