description: >-
  Use when the user wants to turn public reviews - G2, Capterra, app stores,
  Reddit threads, support tickets - into customer research: what people
  complain about and praise, where a competitor is weak, why people switched,
  what features they ask for, and the words happy customers use. Also use when
  the user mentions review mining, voice of customer, G2 reviews, competitor
  reviews, "what do people say about X", review analysis, or wants copy that
  uses the buyer's own language. Counts reviews rather than quotes, reads
  sentiment from star ratings only, and says how much of the text its coding
  reached.

# Review Mining

Your competitors' customers have already written your research. Every G2 page, app-store listing and
Reddit thread about your category holds hundreds of people saying, unprompted, what annoys them,
what they pay for, why they left one product for another and what they wish existed. Most startups
read five of these and remember the angry one. This skill counts all of them.

The engine codes each review into themes, counts how many reviews raise each theme (never how many
times), splits praise from complaint using the star rating only, and compares your product with
each rival theme by theme. It also pulls out every sentence where someone switched products or asked
for a feature, and the phrases your happy reviewers use, which are better headline material than
anything a brainstorm produces.

## When to use

The user wants to know what buyers in a category care about, where a competitor is weak, or what
language to use, and has (or can collect) public reviews. Also before writing a comparison page, a
battlecard or a positioning statement, as evidence for the claims in them.

Do not use it for your own interview notes; `customer-interview-synthesis` codes those with severity.
Do not use it to size demand; reviews are written by the unusually pleased and the unusually angry.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first.** Pull your product name, the competitor set and the
   buyer from `.agents/product-marketing.md`. If none exists, ask for the product and two or three
   rivals.
2. **Collect reviews, 30 or more per product if you can.** Copy them from the review site with the
   star rating, the source and the date. Keep the full text; do not summarise.
3. **Decide who codes.** The engine's word list covers twelve themes common to software reviews and
   reports how many reviews it failed to code. For a category with its own vocabulary (clinics,
   schools, logistics), add themes with `lexicon` or code by hand with `themes` on each review.
4. **Respect the source's terms.** Copy by hand or export what the site allows; do not scrape where
   the terms forbid it, and do not republish a reviewer's text without the site's permission.

## Method

**Count reviews, not quotes.** A theme raised three times in one review is one review.

**Sentiment is the star rating.** Four or five stars is praise, one or two is a complaint, three is
mixed, no rating is a mention only. The engine never infers tone from words, because "the support is
unbelievable" goes both ways.

**Compare like with like.** Each product's theme shares carry a 95% Wilson interval; with fewer than
10 reviews of a product (an engine rule) the intervals are too wide to compare it with another.

**Opportunity rule.** A theme is an opportunity when a rival's complaint share is at least 20% and
yours is at least 10 points lower, with 10 or more reviews each (engine rules, stated so you can
argue with them). An opportunity is a claim you can make with proof, not a claim the engine makes
for you.

**Fix first.** Your own theme with the most complaints, needing at least two.

**Switching sentences and feature asks** are found by phrase ("switched from", "moved to", "wish",
"no way to"), kept whole, and tagged with the product and the rating.

**Buyer language.** Two- and three-word phrases that appear in at least two of your praise reviews,
and separately in at least two rival complaints. The first list is headline material; the second is
the pain your comparison page should name.

## Workflow

**Step 1 - Paste the reviews** with product, rating, source and date. Run the engine.

**Step 2 - Read the coverage line.** Below 60% coded (engine rule) the word list did not fit the
category: add `lexicon` entries from the uncoded reviews, or code by hand, and re-run.

**Step 3 - Spot-check ten lexicon-coded reviews.** A word list matches words, not meaning.

**Step 4 - Take the opportunities into `comparison-pages` and `objection-handling`,** each with
the rival quote the engine attached as the evidence behind the claim.

**Step 5 - Take fix-first to the product team** with its quotes, and the feature asks grouped by
theme.

**Step 6 - Take the praise phrases into `positioning-statement` and `aaj-copywriting`.** Test them
against your current headline with the Five-Second Message Test.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/review-miner.js --demo
node resources/review-miner.js '{"product":"Fieldnote","reviews":[{"product":"Fieldnote","rating":5,"text":"Easy to use."}]}'
node resources/review-miner.js --help
```

`run({ product, reviews, lexicon })` returns per-product theme tables with intervals, opportunities,
fix-first, switching sentences, feature asks, buyer language, coding coverage, findings and a verdict.
Deterministic, offline, no dependencies.

## Present the result

1. **The verdict** and the coverage line (how many reviews were coded by hand, by the word list,
   and not at all).
2. **Your product:** top themes with share, interval and praise/complaint split; fix-first with a quote.
3. **Each rival:** the same table, and the opportunities with the rival quote.
4. **Switching sentences**, grouped by direction (to you, away from you, between rivals).
5. **Feature asks** grouped by theme.
6. **Buyer language**, both lists, with the review count behind each phrase.
7. **What to do next**, in the order of the workflow.

**Show where it came from.** Open your answer with "AAJ `review-mining` engine result:" and print the engine's output block exactly as it returned it (it ends with a Method link). Say the numbers come from the AAJ engine, not from the model. Put your interpretation under that block. Do not retype the figures from memory. If you could not run the engine, say so and label any numbers as your own estimate, not an AAJ result.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never quote a share from fewer than 10 reviews.** Say "3 of 7 mention pricing", not "43%".
- **Never read tone from the text.** If the rating is missing, it is a mention.
- **Never publish a reviewer's words as your testimonial.** A G2 review is G2's and the reviewer's;
  use it as research, and get consent before it appears in your marketing (`claims-and-proof-check`).
- **Reviews are not the market.** They over-represent the delighted and the furious, and review
  sites differ in who writes. Two sources minimum before generalising; the engine flags one source.
- **The word list is a start, not a finding.** Code by hand for anything you will put in a deck.
- **A rival's complaint is an opportunity only if you are better there, provably.** Claim it with
  the evidence, or do not claim it.
