# Marketing Loops

Model growth that compounds because its output feeds back as input — not a funnel with the ends taped together.

Most of the catalog treats growth as a **funnel**: stages, hand-offs, leaks to plug, a linear path from stranger to customer. `lifecycle-and-retention`, `onboarding-activation`, and `signup-flow-optimizer` all optimize that path. This skill is for the other model. A **loop** is growth where each turn produces the input to the next turn — users invite users, content attracts people who make content, revenue funds acquisition that produces revenue.

**The one question a funnel never asks, and a loop lives or dies on: does one turn of the loop produce more than one turn's worth of input?** That ratio is the loop factor, k. It's the single number that separates a channel that compounds from one that merely converts. A funnel optimizer can improve every stage and still never know whether the thing loops, because "does output exceed input" is not a question the funnel frame contains.

**The misconception this skill exists to correct is that k ≥ 1 is the goal.** True virality — every user producing more than one new user, growth sustaining itself with no paid input — is rare, fragile, and usually the wrong target. The durable reality is sub-viral: a k of 0.5 to 0.8 that doesn't run on its own but more than doubles the value of every acquired user. A k=0.6 loop makes each paid acquisition do the work of 2.5. Teams chase k ≥ 1, miss it, and conclude they "don't have a loop" — when the sub-viral loop they do have is quietly the best line item in the model. This skill is built to surface that.

## When to use

The user wants to build a referral or content loop, diagnose why growth isn't compounding, or decide whether a channel is a loop at all. For optimizing the linear conversion path, use `onboarding-activation` or `signup-flow-optimizer`. For whether the unit economics support paid acquisition in the first place, use `unit-economics`. For sequencing loop work into a broader plan, `campaign-orchestrator` routes here.

## Before you start

1. **Draw one turn of the loop as stages.** Not the funnel — the *cycle*. For referral: user sends invites → invite opened → clicked → signed up → (now sends invites). Each stage is a conversion rate; the last stage's output feeds the first.
2. **Get the output per completion.** How many invites, shares, or pieces of content one completed turn produces. This is the branching factor, and it's what can push k above the stage-rate product.
3. **Have real rates, not hopes.** k is a product of rates, so optimism at each stage multiplies into fantasy. Pull the numbers from analytics; if you're estimating, say so and treat the output as a scenario.
4. **Know whether you even have a loop.** If the last stage's output doesn't become the first stage's input, it's a funnel. Model it as one and don't invent feedback that isn't there.

## Method

k is the product of every stage rate times the output per turn. The math is deliberately simple; the discipline is in getting honest rates and reading the result correctly.

Two things the engine computes that change decisions:

**Amplification** — a decaying loop (k < 1) still sums to a finite multiplier, because a seed cohort yields N + Nk + Nk² + … = N/(1−k) total users. k=0.5 doubles; k=0.8 quintuples. This is the number that reframes a "failed" sub-viral loop as a working one.

**The throttle** — because k multiplies stage rates, the *lowest* rate caps the whole loop. A ten-point gain at the throttle lifts k more than a ten-point gain anywhere else. The engine names it, so effort goes to the stage that moves the number rather than the stage that's easiest to touch.

## Run the engine

```bash
node resources/loop-model.js --demo                 # worked example, no args
node resources/loop-model.js score '<json>'         # compute k for one loop
node resources/loop-model.js project '<json>'       # compound it over time
node resources/loop-model.js --help
```

**Score** takes the loop's stages and branching factor, returns k, the verdict band, amplification, effective CAC (if a paid CAC is given), and the throttling stage. **Project** takes a k and a paid feed and shows users period by period, decomposing loop-driven from paid-driven growth so the compounding is visible rather than assumed.

## Workflow

1. **Map one turn** of the loop as stages with real rates, and the output per completion.
2. **Score it** to get k and the verdict. Read the band honestly — sub-viral is the normal, workable case.
3. **Read the throttle** and target it first; it's where a fixed amount of effort moves k most.
4. **Get the effective CAC** if you run paid — the loop pays for k of every acquisition, and that lowered number is what should feed `unit-economics` and `paid-media-budget-allocation`.
5. **Project** with a realistic paid feed to see the compounding, and to decompose how much growth is loop versus paid.
6. **Don't model compounding that isn't there.** If k is near zero, say the channel is a funnel and route the work to the funnel skills.

## Present the result

Lead with k and its verdict band, then what k buys — amplification and effective CAC — then the throttle. For a projection, show the paid-vs-loop decomposition; the gap between total and paid-alone is the entire argument for treating this as a loop.

Be explicit about the sub-viral point every time k lands below 1. Left unsaid, the user reads "k = 0.6" as failure. Said plainly, they read it as "every acquisition worth 2.5×," which is the truth.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **k ≥ 1 is usually the wrong goal.** Sustained virality is rare and fragile. A strong sub-viral loop that amplifies paid is the durable win; don't dismiss it for missing 1.0.
- **k is a product, so optimism compounds.** Four stages each padded 10% inflates k by ~46%. Use measured rates; flag estimates as scenarios.
- **A projection with k ≥ 1 runs away.** The model imposes no saturation ceiling, so an exponential curve is real in shape but fictional in magnitude. Add a ceiling before planning against the number.
- **Fix the throttle, not the easy stage.** The lowest rate caps k. Effort anywhere else is worth less, however tempting the quick win.
- **A funnel with the ends joined is not a loop.** If the output doesn't genuinely re-enter as input, there's no feedback and no compounding. Don't force the frame.
- **The loop lowers CAC; it doesn't make acquisition free.** Effective CAC is paid CAC × (1−k), not zero. Feed the real number into the budget skills.
- **Loops saturate.** Every k is measured at a point in time and tends to fall as the addressable network fills. Re-measure; don't assume today's k holds at scale.
