  the user mentions discovery call, sales call script, qualifying questions,
  sales questions, needs analysis, first call, demo call, or "what should I ask
  on a sales call." Produces a discovery call flow with a prioritized question
  bank, qualification checks, and next-step language that advances the deal.

# Discovery Call Framework

Run a first call that uncovers the real problem and qualifies the deal — by asking, not pitching.

## When to use

When first calls feel like unstructured demos, reps pitch before they understand the problem, or deals advance without real pain ever being identified.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first.** Pull the ICP and the common pains from `.agents/product-marketing.md`. If none exists, ask the user.
2. **Gather inputs:** the qualification criteria (from `sales-process-design` if it exists).
3. **Confirm the objective:** a call that qualifies and surfaces real pain. (For the overall stage design, that's `sales-process-design`; for responses to pushback, `objection-handling`.)

## Method

Spend most of the call on the buyer's problem, not the product. Lead with situation → problem → impact questions before any solution talk, quantify the pain so it can justify budget, and weave the qualification checks in rather than grilling. Close on a concrete, mutually agreed next step — never "I'll follow up."

## Workflow

1. **Open with an agenda** and earn the right to ask questions — including a quick time check.
2. **Lead with situation → problem → impact questions** before any solution talk.
3. **Quantify the pain** ("what does that cost you / how often / what have you tried").
4. **Surface the decision** — who's involved, the timeline, and what happens if they do nothing.
5. **Map answers to the qualification checks** without grilling; weave them in.
6. **Close on a concrete, agreed next step** and present the framework.

## Reference

This skill bundles no data files. Pull the ICP, pains, and qualification criteria from `.agents/product-marketing.md` and from `sales-process-design`.

## Present the result

- The **call flow** (open → situation → problem → impact → decision → next step) with rough timing.
- A **prioritized question bank** per section — the few questions that matter most, first.
- The **qualification checks** and where each gets answered.
- **Next-step language** that actually advances the deal.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Discovery is not a pitch.** If the framework spends more time on the product than the buyer's problem, rebalance it.
- **Quantify the pain.** A problem without impact won't get budget — every pain needs a "what does that cost you."
- **Every qualification check needs a question** that naturally surfaces it; don't interrogate.
- **Always end on a specific next step** — "I'll follow up" is how deals stall.
