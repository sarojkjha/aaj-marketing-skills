  Use when the user wants to turn one pillar asset — a report, blog post,
  webinar, case study, or data study — into a full set of distribution pieces
  across channels (LinkedIn carousel, X/LinkedIn threads, short posts,
  newsletter, stat cards, a short-form video script). Also use when the user
  mentions repurposing, atomizing content, content distribution, turning a report
  into social, "getting more out of" a piece, or a content-to-social flow.
  Produces an inventory of the reusable units in the source and drafted,
  channel-adapted derivatives with a sequencing plan — reusing only what the
  source actually says, never inventing facts or figures.

# Content Repurposing

Turn **one** pillar into a week or more of distribution. The expensive work — the research, the argument, the data — already happened; repurposing is how you get ten times the return on it. The move is to atomize the pillar into its reusable units, then adapt each one to how a given channel is actually read — not to paste the same paragraph everywhere. Every derivative makes one point, links back to the pillar, and reuses only what the source really says.

## When to use

The user has a substantial asset — a report, a long blog post, a webinar, a case study, a data study — and needs to get a full slate of social, email, and short-form pieces out of it without writing everything from scratch.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context** (`.agents/product-marketing.md` / `.agents/aaj-brand.md`) for voice, ICP, and CTA.
2. **Have the pillar in front of you.** Repurposing is extraction, not invention — you can only atomize what's actually there.
3. **Know the channels and the goal.** Which platforms, and what each piece is for (traffic to the pillar, booked calls, list growth).
4. **The no-fabrication rule is non-negotiable.** Every statistic, quote, and claim in a derivative must come from the pillar or a source the pillar cites. Never sharpen a post by inventing a number — if it isn't in the source, it doesn't go in the derivative.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory the reusable units.** Pull from the pillar: the **core thesis** (one sentence), the **key stats** (with their sources), the strongest **quotes / lines**, the **frameworks and lists**, the **counterintuitive claims**, and any **charts/visuals**. This inventory is your raw material — nothing downstream comes from anywhere else.
2. **Map units to formats.** Match each unit to what it suits: core thesis → carousel, thread, newsletter lead; a single striking stat → stat card, hook post; a framework/list → carousel or thread; a strong line → quote graphic or standalone post; the "how" → short how-to post or video script.
3. **Adapt to each channel** using `resources/repurposing-templates.md`. Each format has its own hook, structure, length, and CTA — draft to the template, don't copy-paste the pillar's prose. (Channel specifics below.)
4. **Sequence over time.** Don't dump everything at once — space the derivatives across one to two-plus weeks, lead with the strongest hook, and hold some for later. Each piece links back to the pillar so distribution compounds the canonical page's traffic and authority.
5. **Layer GEO.** Hand the pillar and its derivatives to `geo-content-optimization` — restating the pillar's real stats, quotes, and citations across the web reinforces its authority and its AI-citation odds (quotes, statistics, and citations are the signals that move the needle).

## Channel playbook

- **LinkedIn carousel (PDF/doc, 6–10 slides):** slide 1 is the scroll-stopper (the boldest stat or the contrarian claim, large); middle slides make one point each and stay skimmable; the penultimate slide is the takeaway; the last is the CTA. Upload the PDF natively as a document. Re-upload to the personal profile rather than resharing from the company page, and leave 24–48 hours between the company and personal posts.
- **X / Twitter thread:** tweet 1 is the hook (a bold number or claim, no link); each following tweet makes one point with its data or example; the final tweet is the takeaway plus the link. For newer accounts, threads tend to outperform carousels on X.
- **LinkedIn text post:** the first one or two lines must hook before the "…more" fold; keep the body to a single insight with short lines and whitespace; end on a question or soft CTA.
- **Newsletter blurb:** the subject/preview line is the hook; the body delivers the one insight in a few sentences and why it matters; link to the pillar.
- **Stat card (single image):** one striking number, a one-line point of view, and the source — the format AAJ uses for data clusters.
- **Short-form video / reel script:** land the hook in the first three seconds (number or claim on screen and spoken), deliver one insight, end on a CTA.
- **Quote graphic:** one strong line from the pillar with attribution.

## Present the result

Deliver the **unit inventory**, then the **drafted derivatives** — a carousel outline with slide copy, a full thread, two or three posts, a newsletter blurb, and stat-card lines — and a **sequencing calendar** showing what posts where and when, each linking back to the pillar.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Reuse, never invent.** Every stat and quote traces to the source; no number gets added for punch.
- **One idea per piece.** A derivative makes a single point — it is not a summary of the whole pillar.
- **Adapt, don't paste.** Rewrite for each channel's native format and hook; the same block of text everywhere reads as spam and performs like it.
- **Always link back.** Each derivative points to the pillar — that's what turns distribution into compounding traffic and authority.
- **Upload native.** Especially LinkedIn carousels — native documents beat link-outs and reshares.
- **Space the cadence.** Don't burn every derivative in a day; a paced rollout keeps the pillar alive for weeks.
- **Keep the attribution.** Stat cards and quote graphics carry their source; it's what makes them credible and citable.
