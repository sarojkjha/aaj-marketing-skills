description: >-
  Use when the user is working a B2B deal, or marketing to a B2B segment, and
  needs to know everyone who has to say yes - the champion, the budget owner,
  the users, security, legal, procurement, the blocker - what each must come
  to believe, whether they can be reached, and which asset answers them. Also
  use when the user mentions buying committee, buying group, stakeholder map,
  multi-threading, economic buyer, "who signs", deal stalled, single-threaded,
  or wants to know which sales asset to build next. Produces the map, the
  holes in it, the next conversations in order, and the assets to build.

# Buying Committee Map

The persona is one person. The deal is six. A startup that markets to the practice manager and
never meets the COO finds out at the signature stage that the COO has questions, and a deal that was
"closing this month" for three months is usually a map with one name on it.

This skill draws the map for a deal, or for the typical deal in a segment, and reads it the way a
good sales manager would in a pipeline review: who have we not identified, who can we not reach,
what does each person need to believe that we have no proof for, and who is against us with nobody
working on it. The engine orders the next conversations and lists the assets to build; it does not
score the deal.

## When to use

In a deal review when a deal has stalled or is single-threaded. In segment marketing, to decide
which assets each role needs before the first campaign. Before a sales-enablement build, to know
which role each asset serves.

Not for forecasting (`pipeline-and-forecast`) and not for qualifying whether the account fits
(`target-account-list`).

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first** (`.agents/product-marketing.md`) for the buyer roles
   already written down and the proof points on file.
2. **For a live deal, use real names.** A title is a role; a person is a name. The engine counts a
   role as identified only when someone is named.
3. **Write the belief as a sentence that could be false.** "Payback inside two quarters" can be
   proved or not; "sees the value" cannot.
4. **Be honest about access.** "Via champion" means the champion carries your case; "none" means
   nobody is carrying it.

## Method

Nine roles: champion, economic buyer, end user, technical, security-legal, procurement, executive,
influencer, blocker. The first three are the core (engine rule); a map without them is incomplete.

For each person: identified or not; access (direct, via champion, none); stance (for, neutral,
against, unknown); the belief; the asset; the plan.

**Reading the map, in order.**

1. **A blocker with no plan** outranks everything. Someone against the deal whom nobody is working
   on will win, because silence is cheaper than argument.
2. **An economic buyer you have not identified or cannot reach** means the deal has no close date.
3. **Beliefs with no asset** are the sales-enablement backlog, and the engine suggests the asset type
   for each role.
4. **Unknown stances** are conversations to have before the next meeting.

Coverage is the share of roles that are identified, reachable and answered. It is a checklist
measure, not a win probability.

## Workflow

**Step 1 - Draw the map** with the champion, in the champion's words: "who signs, who else has to
say yes, who could say no, who will use it, who reviews security?"

**Step 2 - Run the engine.** Take the verdict and the first next conversation.

**Step 3 - Handle the blocker first-hand.** Hear the objection yourself; a relayed objection is
half an objection. `objection-handling` gives the structure.

**Step 4 - Reach the economic buyer.** Equip the champion with a one-page case for that person,
then ask for twenty minutes. If the champion will not make the introduction, that is information.

**Step 5 - Build the missing assets** in the order of the roles that block the close, with
`aaj-sales-enablement`; put security answers in the Security Questionnaire Answer Library.

**Step 6 - Re-run before each pipeline review.** The stances change; the map should too.

For a segment rather than a deal, run it with typical titles and no names: the asset list is the
campaign plan, one piece per role.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/buying-committee.js --demo
node resources/buying-committee.js '{"deal":"Northside Dental","roles":[{"role":"champion","name":"R. Ortiz","access":"direct","stance":"for","mustBelieve":"...","asset":"ROI sheet"}]}'
node resources/buying-committee.js --help
```

`run({ deal, roles })` returns the map, coverage, next conversations, assets to build, findings and
a verdict. Deterministic, offline, no dependencies.

## Present the result

1. **The verdict** and coverage.
2. **The map** as a table: role, person, access, stance, must believe, asset, plan.
3. **Next conversations**, numbered.
4. **Assets to build**, each with the role and the suggested form.
5. **Findings**.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never let a title stand in for a person.** "The CFO" is a hole in the map until there is a name.
- **Never score the deal from this.** Coverage says what you know, not what will happen.
- **Never assume a role is absent because nobody mentioned it.** Security, legal and procurement
  appear late and add weeks; ask.
- **Beliefs are per person, not per company.** The COO and the IT contractor need different proof.
- **A happy champion is not a deal.** The map exists so that the champion is not the only name.
- **Treat anything the champion tells you about others as a hypothesis** until you have heard it
  from them.
