  Use when the user is deciding how to staff marketing leadership - hire a
  head of marketing or CMO, bring in a fractional CMO, or retain an agency -
  and wants the comparison on their own numbers rather than a vendor's. Also
  use when the user mentions fractional CMO, in-house vs agency, first
  marketing hire, marketing team structure, cost of a marketing hire, ramp
  time, or "should we hire or outsource marketing". Prices all three options
  over a horizon including ramp, search time, recruiting and the founder's
  own hours, finds the month the lines cross, prices the exit, and checks
  which shape of help fits the work that actually exists.

  inputs: Your horizon, your own hourly value and monthly tools cost; for a hire, base salary, load, recruiting fee, months to find and start, ramp and your weekly management hours; for a fractional leader, retainer, execution you would still buy, ramp, management hours and notice; for an agency, retainer, setup fee, ramp, management hours and minimum term; and the hours a week of leadership and execution the work actually is
  outputs: Total cost per option over the horizon with every line, cost per productive month, your hours, the month the in-house line crosses below the retainer if it ever does, what each option has cost and still owes if you stop at month six, and an in-house, fractional, fractional-plus-execution or agency call on the shape of the work

# Marketing Leadership Model

Three things make a spreadsheet comparison of a marketing hire, a fractional leader and an agency
wrong, and they are the same three every time. Ramp: every option costs full price before it
produces full output. Search time: a hire you start looking for in January is not working in
January. Your own hours: the cheapest option on paper is often the one that eats the most of the
founder's week.

This skill counts all three, divides by productive months rather than calendar months, and then
asks the question the cost comparison cannot answer: does the company need judgement, hands, or
both? Two of the options give you judgement; one can give you judgement and hands.

## When to use

The user is making a first marketing leadership decision, replacing someone, or reviewing a
retainer at renewal. It applies from pre-seed to Series B; only the numbers change.

Do not use it to set the marketing budget itself; `marketing-budget-planning` does that. Do not
use it to plan the work; `campaign-orchestrator` sequences the work once someone owns it.

## Before you start

1. **Get real quotes and a real salary band.** Every figure in the comparison is one you enter;
   the engine has no benchmarks and its demo numbers are starting assumptions only.
2. **Count the execution you would still have to buy** under a fractional arrangement. A
   strategy-only retainer does not write the emails.
3. **Estimate the hours a week the work is**, split into leadership (planning, deciding,
   reviewing) and execution (writing, building, running). Ask the last person who did it.
4. **Put a value on your own hour**, roughly. It is the scarcest input you have.

## Method

**Fully loaded cost per option.** In-house: salary for the months after the search, load (payroll,
benefits, bonus, equity), recruiting fee, tools, and your management hours at your own rate.
Fractional: retainer, execution you still buy, tools, your hours. Agency: retainer, setup fee,
tools, your hours. Percentages are whole numbers.

**Productive months, not calendar months.** A month before anyone starts counts for nothing; a
month in ramp counts as half (an engine rule); a month after ramp counts fully. Cost per
productive month is the number that compares.

**The crossover.** Built from each option's real monthly rate and real one-off cost, so it does
not move when the horizon changes. The engine reports the first month, after the hire has actually
started, where the in-house line falls below the retainer and stays below; or says it never does
and by how much a month.

**The exit.** Two numbers at month six (or the horizon if shorter): what has already left the bank,
and what leaving still obliges you to pay. A hire assumes no severance; a fractional leader owes the
notice period; an agency owes the rest of the minimum term. The exit table prices the sunk cash. It
cannot price the months of momentum, which is usually the larger number.

**The fit.** AAJ's rules, labelled as such: thirty or more hours a week of leadership is a
full-time role, so hire; twenty or more hours of execution with nobody in-house to do it needs
hands, so a strategy-only retainer will not do; hands in channels you lack point at an agency or
specialist contractors; part-time judgement with execution covered is what a fractional arrangement
is for. Deciding for under six months rules out a hire on time alone. A founder with under two
hours a week is warned off the option that needs the most of them.

## Workflow

**Step 1 - Shape.** Run the fit check on the hours. It says which options are even in the frame.

**Step 2 - Price.** Run the comparison on real quotes over the horizon you are deciding for, then
again at 24 and 36 months.

**Step 3 - Read the crossover.** If the hire never becomes cheaper, check the load and the
execution line before believing it. If it crosses inside the horizon, the question is whether you
can wait through the search and ramp.

**Step 4 - Read the exit.** Decide which wrong outcome you can afford.

**Step 5 - Decide, and write down the review date**, usually the crossover month or the end of the
minimum term.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/leadership-model.js --demo
```

`run({ compare, fit })` returns each option's lines, total, productive months, cost per productive
month and your hours; the cheapest; the crossover against the fractional (or agency) option; the
exit table; and the fit verdict with notes. Any of the three options may be omitted.

## Present the result

1. **The three totals** and cost per productive month, with the founder's hours beside each.
2. **The crossover month**, or that there is none, and the monthly gap.
3. **The exit table**: spent and still owed at month six.
4. **The fit call**, and what it rules out.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never compare on salary against retainer.** Compare fully loaded cost per productive month.
- **Never leave out ramp and search.** It is why in-house looks cheaper than it turns out to be.
- **Never treat a strategy retainer as a marketing team.** Count the execution you still buy.
- **Do not quote a benchmark.** Every figure here is one the user entered.
- **Seniority is not interchangeable.** Whether you need judgement or hands is the actual
  question; price comes second.
