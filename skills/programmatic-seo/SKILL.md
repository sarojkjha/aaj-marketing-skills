# Programmatic SEO

Generate hundreds or thousands of pages from a template and a dataset — but **decide whether it pays back before writing the first one**. Programmatic SEO fails in a predictable way: a team multiplies page count by search volume, gets a large number, builds ten thousand pages, and discovers that most were never indexed and almost none rank.

The arithmetic that matters isn't `pages × volume`. It's the funnel: how many pages get indexed, how many of those reach page one, and what each one is worth. Run that first. It kills most programmatic projects, which is the point — the ones it doesn't kill are worth doing properly.

The second thing that decides the outcome is whether each page deserves to exist. A page assembled from a template and facts anyone can look up is what Google's scaled-content-abuse policy targets. Unique per-page data is not a nice-to-have; it is the difference between an asset and a liability.

## When to use

The user has a dataset, a directory, or a head-term × modifier pattern and wants to turn it into search-targeted pages at scale. For a single page, use `seo-content-brief` instead.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context** (`.agents/product-marketing.md`) for the offer these pages should route toward.
2. **Establish the pattern.** What's the head term, what varies, and where does the data come from? "Best {tool} for {industry}" needs both lists and a real basis for the ranking.
3. **Find the unique data.** For each page, what exists that a competitor couldn't regenerate in an afternoon? If the answer is nothing, the honest recommendation is not to build.
4. **Get the economics.** Conversion rate, value per conversion, and what the build actually costs. Without these the model is decoration.

## Method

Three gates, in order. Fail any and stop.

**Gate 1 — Does the maths work?** Run the engine. Model the indexation and ranking funnel honestly rather than assuming every page ranks. If payback runs past 18 months, this is a long bet on a channel a single core update can reset.

**Gate 2 — Does each page deserve to exist?** Every page needs something a competitor can't trivially reproduce: proprietary data, computed results, genuine reviews, real inventory. Template + public facts is the doorway-page pattern.

**Gate 3 — Can the site support it?** Crawl budget, internal linking, and site architecture decide whether pages get indexed at all. A thousand orphaned pages reachable only from a sitemap will mostly sit unindexed.

Only then spec the template.

See `resources/pseo-playbook.md` for the page-type patterns that work, the template anatomy, the indexation plan, the quality bar, and a worked example.

## Run the engine

Model viability before committing:

> Paths assume you installed with `npx skills add`. From a clone of this repo, use `skills/programmatic-seo/resources/…` instead.

```bash
node .agents/skills/programmatic-seo/resources/pseo-model.js  # demo
node .agents/skills/programmatic-seo/resources/pseo-model.js --pages 500 --volume 40 --conv 2 --value 400
node .agents/skills/programmatic-seo/resources/pseo-model.js --unique-data strong --fixed-cost 8000
node .agents/skills/programmatic-seo/resources/pseo-model.js --json --pages 200
node .agents/skills/programmatic-seo/resources/pseo-model.js --help
```

It runs the funnel (pages → indexed → ranking), projects sessions, conversions and value, computes payback and cost per ranking page, and flags the failure patterns — thin query volume, missing per-page data, doorway-scale builds, optimistic indexation assumptions.

Defaults imply roughly 18% of built pages produce any traffic. That is deliberately sobering and roughly matches what teams report. Override every assumption with your own Search Console data as soon as you have it — the model's job is to make the assumptions explicit, not to be right by default.

## Workflow

1. **Define the pattern** — head term, modifiers, and the data source behind each page.
2. **Estimate honestly.** Pull real volume for a sample of the long tail rather than extrapolating from the head term, which is always higher.
3. **Run the engine.** If the verdict is DON'T BUILD, say so and explain which input would have to change.
4. **Pilot 50 pages.** Never launch the full set. Fifty pages tells you the real indexation rate, the real ranking rate, and the real conversion rate — then re-run the model with actual numbers.
5. **Spec the template** — the fixed structure, the variable slots, and critically the unique element per page.
6. **Plan indexation** — internal linking from real pages (not just a sitemap), hub pages, crawl-budget considerations, and how new pages get discovered.
7. **Set the quality bar** — the minimum each page must contain to ship. Pages that fail it don't publish.
8. **Stage the rollout** — 50 → measure → 500 → measure → full set. Each gate is a re-run of the model with observed data.

## Present the result

Lead with the **verdict and the funnel**, not the projected traffic. The funnel is what changes the user's mind; the traffic number is what they already imagined.

If the recommendation is not to build, say it plainly and name the one input that would have to change to make it viable. A skill that always says yes to programmatic SEO is a liability.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never project `pages × volume × CTR` without an indexation and ranking funnel.** This is the single most common error and it inflates projections by roughly five to ten times.
- **Pilot before scaling.** Fifty pages costs almost nothing and replaces every assumption in the model with measured data.
- **Unique data per page is the whole game.** Without it you're building doorway pages, and scaled-content-abuse enforcement is explicit about this.
- **Long-tail volume data is unreliable.** Keyword tools round up and invent volume for tail terms. Treat sub-50 estimates as directional at best.
- **Orphaned pages don't get indexed.** If pages are only reachable from a sitemap, expect most to sit unindexed indefinitely. Plan internal linking as part of the build, not after.
- **Watch the ratio.** Adding 10,000 template pages to a 40-page site changes what the site *is* in a crawler's view. That's a site-wide risk, not a contained experiment.
- **Don't generate pages for queries that don't exist.** Modifiers that produce zero real searches produce zero traffic and dilute the whole set.
- **AI Overviews reduce clicks on informational queries.** Model it explicitly rather than assuming historical CTR holds.
- **Have a kill criterion.** Decide in advance what indexation or ranking rate at the pilot stage means "stop", and honour it.
