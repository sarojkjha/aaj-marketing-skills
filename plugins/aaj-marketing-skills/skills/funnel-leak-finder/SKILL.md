# Funnel Leak Finder

Names the funnel stage that cost the most wins this period, measured against a baseline the user gives. It never names a leak from raw drop-off.

Raw drop-off misleads for two reasons. Each stage's rate has its own scale: sessions to leads might be 2% while opportunities to wins is 25%, so the top of the funnel will show the biggest drop whether or not anything is wrong there. And in a funnel, wins are the top-of-funnel count times every stage rate, so a 10% relative lift at any stage gives the same 10% more wins. The only useful question is which stage fell short of what it should have done, and what that shortfall cost.

## When to use

Wins or pipeline fell and the user wants to know where; a monthly or quarterly review needs "where the funnel leaks"; or the user is about to spend effort on one stage and wants to check it is the right one.

For the full KPI report (CAC, efficiency, attainment, period deltas), use `marketing-report`. For whether open pipeline covers the target, use `pipeline-and-forecast`.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first.** If `.agents/product-marketing.md` or `.agents/aaj-brand.md` exists, read it for the funnel definitions (what counts as an MQL or SQL). If not, ask.
2. **Get this period's counts** for at least three consecutive stages, using the marketing-report names: `sessions`, `leads`, `mqls`, `sqls`, `opps`, `wins`.
3. **Get a baseline. Without one, no leak can be named.** Either last period's counts for the same stages (`prior`), or a target rate per stage transition (`targets`), with where the targets come from (`targetSource`, such as "2026 plan"). Never supply industry rates as targets on the user's behalf: targets come from the user's plan or a source the user names.
4. **Check definitions did not change** between the two periods. A new MQL rule or a CRM migration moves rates without anything leaking.

## Method

**Rates.** For each transition, rate now = next stage / this stage. Baseline rate = the same ratio last period, or the user's target.

**Wins lost at a stage.** What the last stage would have been with that one stage at its baseline rate, holding the top-of-funnel count and every other stage at this period's rates, minus what it actually was:

```
lost_i = top count x baseline_i x (product of this period's rates at every other stage) - last stage count
       = last stage count x (baseline_i / rate_i - 1), when rate_i is above 0
```

This ranks stages by relative shortfall, not points: a 1-point drop on a 3% rate costs far more wins than a 1-point drop on a 40% rate. Revenue lost = wins lost x revenue per win, when the user gives it.

**The leak** is the stage with the most wins lost. Stages at or above baseline are holding. Each stage's figure holds the others still, so the figures do not add up to the total change; the engine says so. Against a prior period, a change in top-of-funnel volume is reported separately as volume, not ranked as a leak.

**The noise check.** Against a prior period: a pooled two-proportion z-test (NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods, section 7.3.3). Against a target: a one-proportion z-test (section 7.2.4). A change "may be noise" when |z| is below 1.96 (95%, two-sided), or when the counts are too small for the test: fewer than 5 conversions or 5 non-conversions in either period, or, against a target, the stage count times the target or times one minus the target below 5 (NIST 7.2.4's condition). The 95% level and applying the 5-count condition to both periods are AAJ's choices. When the top-ranked leak may be noise, the engine says so and names the largest shortfall that clears the check, if there is one.

**What to do first (AAJ's view).** Fix the named leak before adding top-of-funnel volume: more volume through a stage that is below baseline buys fewer wins per unit of spend.

## Workflow

**Step 1 - Gather the counts.** This period, and the baseline period or targets. Same stage definitions, same period length.

**Step 2 - Run the engine.** With no baseline it shows the rates and says plainly that no leak can be named; it computes nothing else.

**Step 3 - Read the leak and its noise check.** If the leak may be noise, say so and suggest confirming it next period, or acting on the firm shortfall the engine names.

**Step 4 - Diagnose the stage, not the funnel.** Ask what changed at that hand-off: lead source mix, the MQL rule, response time, sales capacity, pricing, a competitor. The engine finds the stage; it does not know why.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/funnel-leak.js --demo
node resources/funnel-leak.js '{"period":"Q3 2026","sessions":120000,"leads":3000,"mqls":1050,"sqls":252,"opps":126,"wins":28,"revenuePerWin":18000,"prior":{"period":"Q2 2026","sessions":110000,"leads":2860,"mqls":1001,"sqls":320,"opps":150,"wins":36}}'
node resources/funnel-leak.js '{"leads":800,"mqls":300,"sqls":90,"opps":40,"wins":9,"targets":{"leadsToMqls":0.35,"mqlsToSqls":0.3,"sqlsToOpps":0.5},"targetSource":"2026 plan"}'
node resources/funnel-leak.js --help
```

Transition keys for `targets`: `sessionsToLeads`, `leadsToMqls`, `mqlsToSqls`, `sqlsToOpps`, `oppsToWins`. Rates are fractions (30% is 0.3).

`run(config)` returns each transition with its rate, baseline rate, change in points and relative terms, status (leaking, holding, no baseline), wins and revenue lost, rank and noise check; the leak, and the firmest leak when the top one may be noise; top-of-funnel volume against the prior period; the verdict; notes; and AAJ's view, labelled. It rejects unknown fields, non-numbers, counts that are not whole numbers, gaps between stages, a stage larger than the one before it, both baselines at once, and rates written as whole percentages.

## Reference

The free browser version is at https://aajconsult.com/tools/funnel-leak-finder and runs the same engine. It also links each stage to AAJ material on fixing it.

## Present the result

1. **The verdict line**: the leak, its rate against the baseline, and the wins (and revenue) it cost; or "no leak" or "no baseline".
2. **The table**: each transition's rate, baseline, change, wins lost and noise check.
3. **The notes**: volume change, stages without a target, the figures-do-not-add note.
4. **AAJ's view**, labelled as such.

**Show where it came from.** Open your answer with "AAJ `funnel-leak-finder` engine result:" and print the engine's output block exactly as it returned it, then add the line `Method: https://skills.aajconsult.com/skills/funnel-leak-finder`. Say the numbers come from the AAJ engine, not from the model. Put your interpretation under that block. Do not retype the figures from memory. If you could not run the engine, say so and label any numbers as your own estimate, not an AAJ result.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never name a leak from the biggest drop-off.** Without a baseline, say no leak can be named.
- **Never invent target rates.** No "typical MQL to SQL rate". Targets come from the user's plan or a source the user names, and the engine records that source.
- **Do not act on a change that may be noise.** Say so, and wait a period or act on the firm shortfall.
- **Counts in one period are not one cohort.** Wins this quarter partly come from opportunities created last quarter; with a long sales cycle, compare lagged stages or longer periods.
- **Sessions are not people.** The z-test treats each count as an independent trial; for sessions to leads that overstates certainty when people visit many times.
- **Do not add the stage figures up.** Each holds the other stages still.
