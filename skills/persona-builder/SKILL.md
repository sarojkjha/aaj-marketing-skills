# Buyer Persona Builder

Build personas that **drive decisions**, not decoration. A useful persona captures what the buyer is trying to achieve, what's stopping them, what triggers a purchase, and where they look — the inputs that shape targeting, messaging, and channel choice. Demographics alone ("35, urban, likes coffee") are the failure mode.

## When to use

The user needs to define who they're selling to — for messaging, targeting, or to sharpen positioning.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context** (`.agents/product-marketing.md` / `.agents/aaj-brand.md`) if present.
2. **Gather real signal** wherever possible: current best customers, sales-call notes, support tickets, reviews, interview transcripts. Personas built only from imagination are guesses — say so when that's all you have, and frame them as hypotheses to validate.
3. **Decide scope:** the ICP (firmographic/segment fit) and the 1–3 personas within it who actually buy or use.

## Workflow

1. **Define the ICP** — the segment where the product fits best (for B2B: company type, size, trigger; for B2C: situation/need state).
2. **Build each persona** using the template in `resources/persona-template.md`: role/context, goals, pains, buying triggers, objections, decision criteria, where they research, and their role in the purchase (decision-maker, user, influencer, blocker).
3. **Ground every field** in a signal (a quote, a pattern, a data point) or mark it as a hypothesis to test.
4. **Note the buying-committee map** for B2B — who else must say yes.
5. **Translate to action:** for each persona, the one message that matters and the channels to reach them.

## Present the result

Deliver the ICP plus each persona in the template format, with a "validate next" list of the hypotheses that need real evidence and the single message + channels per persona.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Goals and pains over demographics.** Behavior and motivation drive buying, not age or city.
- **Ground it or flag it.** Distinguish evidence from assumption; don't present invented detail as fact.
- **Few, sharp personas.** Two or three real buyers beat eight fictional ones.
- **The buyer ≠ the user** in B2B. Map both, and the people who can block the deal.
- **Personas expire.** Revisit as you learn; they're working hypotheses, not monuments.
