  Use when the user wants to know how mature their marketing is as a whole -
  where the function is strong, where it is weak, and what to fix first -
  or wants a structured way to assess a client's or a portfolio company's
  marketing. Also use when the user mentions marketing maturity, marketing
  audit, growth audit, marketing health check, "where do we stand", "what
  should we fix first", or a before-and-after on the marketing function.
  Scores the 18 statements of AAJ's Marketing Maturity Scorecard across six
  dimensions, names the weak links for the company's stage, asks for the
  evidence behind high self-scores, and compares with a previous run. Not a
  benchmark against other companies.

    Scores marketing as a system across six dimensions, and names the weak links to fix first for your stage.

  agents: [Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, Windsurf, Cline]
  inputs: An answer from 0 (not yet) to 3 (fully) to each of 18 statements, three per dimension - positioning, audience and demand, website and conversion, sales and pipeline, retention and expansion, measurement and economics; optionally the company's stage, whether the evidence behind each dimension was checked, and the answers from a previous run
  outputs: A 0-100 score per dimension and overall with its band (Scattered, Emerging, Established, Compounding), the two or three weak links to fix first in order with the move and the skills to run, flags on any high self-score with no evidence, and the change per dimension since the previous run

# Marketing Maturity Assessment

Marketing maturity is how well the function works as a connected system rather than a pile of
tactics: a clear position, a repeatable demand engine, a site that converts, a qualified pipeline,
retention that compounds, and measurement that ties it all to decisions. Most teams are strong in
two of those and blind to which two are holding the rest back.

This skill runs AAJ's Marketing Maturity Scorecard as an agent: eighteen statements, three per
dimension, each answered not yet / partly / mostly / fully. The scoring is the scorecard's, with
no hidden weighting. What the agent adds is discipline the browser tool cannot enforce: it asks
for the evidence behind any dimension that scores high, and it compares with the last run so the
number means something over time. The bands are AAJ's qualitative thresholds, not percentiles;
nothing here says where you rank against other companies.

## When to use

The user wants a first read on a marketing function (their own, a client's, a portfolio
company's), a shared vocabulary for what to fix first, or a re-read after a quarter of work.

Do not use it to plan the work in detail; `campaign-orchestrator` sequences the skills once the
weak links are known. Do not use it as a benchmark; it is not one.

## Before you start

1. **Answer as the company is today**, not as the roadmap says. "Partly" is the honest answer
   more often than "mostly".
2. **Have the artefacts to hand** for anything you are about to score high: the written
   positioning statement, the ICP, CAC by channel, the forecast against actual, NRR and GRR, the
   date of the last metrics review. The engine will ask.
3. **Pick the stage** (pre-seed, seed, Series A, Series B). It changes which weak links come first,
   not the scores.
4. **Keep the previous run's answers** so the next one can show the change.

## Method

**Six dimensions, three statements each.** Positioning & Messaging; Audience & Demand; Website &
Conversion; Sales & Pipeline; Retention & Expansion; Measurement & Economics. Each statement is
scored 0-3; a dimension is the sum out of 9, normalised to 0-100; the overall score is the equal
average of the six.

**Four bands.** Scattered (0-39): capable tactics that are not yet a system. Emerging (40-64): a
system taking shape with a few clear gaps. Established (65-84): a working system whose weak links
are worth sharpening. Compounding (85-100): the maths compounds and the work is the next leverage
point.

**Weak links for the stage.** The two lowest dimensions, with the stage's focus dimensions first
on a tie; a third is named only if it scores under 50 (the scorecard's rule). Pre-seed focuses on
positioning and demand; seed on demand and conversion; Series A on conversion, pipeline and
measurement; Series B on retention and measurement. Each weak link comes with the move and the
skills that make it.

**Evidence.** A dimension scoring 67 or above ("mostly" across the board, an engine rule) with no
evidence marked is flagged, with the artefact to check. A dimension where one statement is
"fully" and another "not yet" is flagged too: the average hides it.

**Change.** With a previous run, the engine reports the change per dimension and overall, notes
when nothing moved, and asks about any fall: a score can drop because the bar rose or because
something lapsed, and those need different responses.

## Workflow

**Step 1 - Score**, honestly, with the stage set.

**Step 2 - Check the evidence** for anything flagged. Re-score if the artefact is not there.

**Step 3 - Take the weak links in order** into `campaign-orchestrator`, or straight into the
skills named against each.

**Step 4 - Re-run in a quarter** with the previous answers attached. The change is the report.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/maturity-assessment.js --demo
node resources/maturity-assessment.js --help     # prints the 18 statements
```

`run({ stage, answers, evidence, previous })` returns the overall score and band, each
dimension's score, band and answers, the ordered weak links with move, skills and evidence to
check, findings, and the delta against the previous run.

## Present the result

1. **Score and band**, in one line, with the stage note.
2. **The six dimensions** as a table, with the change since last time if there is one.
3. **The weak links in order**, each with the move and the first skill to run.
4. **The evidence flags**, and what to go and find.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never present the score as a benchmark.** It is a self-assessment against AAJ's thresholds.
- **Never accept "fully" without the artefact.** A positioning statement nobody can find is
  "partly".
- **Do not fix the six in parallel.** Two weak links at a time; the scorecard is built to choose.
- **Do not skip the stage.** A Series B company with weak positioning and weak retention should
  fix retention first; a pre-seed one the reverse.
- **Do not re-run monthly.** The statements move in quarters.
