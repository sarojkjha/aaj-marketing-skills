  Use when the user wants to audit a web page or site for SEO, GEO (generative-
  engine / AI citation readiness), and AEO (answer-engine / featured-snippet
  readiness). Also use when the user mentions SEO audit, AI search visibility,
  getting cited by ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude, featured snippets, llms.txt,
  schema, crawlability, or "why don't we show up in AI answers." Produces a
  0–100 score across 5 weighted categories, a grade, and prioritized fixes.

# SEO / GEO / AEO Readiness Audit

Score how well a page is built to **rank in search (SEO), get cited by AI engines (GEO), and win the direct answer (AEO)** — then return a prioritized fix list. Modern visibility is three layers on one page, and most pages are strong on classic SEO while invisible to AI engines.

## When to use

The user wants to know why a page isn't ranking or being cited by AI, or wants a readiness check before/after publishing.

## Before you start

1. **Get the page as a crawler sees it.** Fetch the URL — and critically, fetch it the way a bot does. Run `curl -A "GPTBot" <url>` (or fetch and inspect the raw HTML). If the body, meta, and JSON-LD are missing from the initial response, the site is client-side rendered and **most other wins are blocked until SSR/prerender ships** — this is the single most important finding.
2. **Also retrieve** `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` for that domain.

## Workflow

1. **Evaluate all 27 checks** in `resources/scoring-rubric.md`, recording `pass` / `partial` / `fail` for each. The rubric defines exactly what each check means and how to test it.
2. **Score it** — feed the results to the engine:
   ```bash
   node resources/score.js '{"checks":{"ssr_prerender":"fail","title_tag":"pass", ...}}'
   node resources/score.js --help
   ```
   It returns category scores, a 0–100 total, a letter grade, and the failing checks.
3. **Prioritize fixes** by impact: rendering/crawlability first (it gates everything), then the cheapest high-value GEO/AEO wins (answer-first passage, FAQPage schema, llms.txt, inline statistics and citations), then on-page and authority polish.
4. **Present** the score, the category breakdown, and a short, ordered remediation plan.

## Scoring model

Five weighted categories: **Technical & Crawlability 25 · On-Page SEO 20 · AEO 20 · GEO 20 · Authority & Trust 15.** Each category scores by pass-rate × weight. Grades: A ≥ 90, B 75–89, C 60–74, D 45–59, F < 45. GEO checks are anchored to the Princeton GEO study's measured citation lifts (statistics, citations, quotations, terminology).

## Present the result

Lead with the headline score and grade, then the five-category bar, then the top fixes in priority order with the expected effect of each. Be concrete: name the missing schema, the absent llms.txt, the empty-shell render — not "improve SEO."

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Rendering gates everything.** A perfect on-page score on an un-prerendered SPA is still near-invisible to AI engines — always test the crawler-eye HTML first and lead with it.
- **GEO ≠ SEO.** Ranking and being cited by an LLM are different; a page can win one and lose the other. Score both.
- **Schema must mirror visible text.** FAQ/Article schema that doesn't match on-page content is a liability, not a win.
- **Don't conflate score with traffic.** This measures readiness; pair it with analytics for outcomes.
