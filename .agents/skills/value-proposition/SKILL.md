  promise of a product for a specific audience. Also use when the user mentions
  value prop, core promise, "what do we say we do", main message, hero message,
  tagline, or "why should anyone buy this." Produces a one-line value
  proposition plus supporting proof points, with variants by audience.

# Value Proposition

Turn what a product does into a single promise a specific buyer believes and can act on — the message everything else hangs off.

## When to use

When the user needs a crisp value proposition for a homepage hero, deck, or campaign; when messaging feels generic, feature-led, or doesn't say who it's for; or when a new audience or segment needs its own framing.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first.** Pull the ICP/segment, the product's core capability, the top customer pain, the differentiator, and proof (metrics, outcomes) from `.agents/product-marketing.md`. If missing, ask the user for three things: who it's for, the main problem solved, and one proof point.
2. **Gather inputs:** the segment to lead with, if there's more than one.
3. **Confirm the objective:** a defensible one-liner. If category and competitive frame aren't settled, run `positioning-statement` first; if the user wants the full hierarchy, use `messaging-framework`.

## Method

A value proposition leads with the outcome the buyer gets, names who it's for, and attaches the mechanism and proof that make it believable — and hard for a competitor to copy. Write the promise as outcome → because → mechanism, then prove it. No proof means it's a slogan.

## Workflow

1. **Name the buyer and the job** they hire the product to do — specific, not "for teams."
2. **Lead with the outcome, not the feature;** then attach the mechanism.
3. **Attach 2–3 proof points** (a metric, an outcome, a credible mechanism).
4. **Draft the one-liner:** *For [buyer] who [need], [product] is the [category] that [outcome], because [mechanism].* Then a hero version ≤ 15 words.
5. **Pressure-test** — could a competitor paste the same line? Would the buyer recognize their words? Sharpen until both pass.
6. **Make variants** for the top 1–2 segments if they differ, and present.

## Reference

This skill bundles no data files. Pull the buyer, pain, differentiator, and proof from `.agents/product-marketing.md`.

## Present the result

- **Value proposition (hero):** one line, ≤ 15 words.
- **Full statement:** the For/who/is-the/that/because sentence.
- **Proof points:** 2–3 bullets.
- **Variants:** per segment, if applicable.
- **Why it holds:** one line on the differentiator that makes it hard to copy.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Name a specific buyer.** "For businesses" is not an audience; the promise must be for someone.
- **Lead with the outcome, not features.** A feature list isn't a value proposition.
- **Include real proof.** Without it, the line is a slogan the buyer won't believe.
- **Pass the competitor test.** If a rival could paste the same sentence, the differentiator isn't sharp enough — fix it.
