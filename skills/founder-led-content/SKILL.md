  Use when a founder wants to run their own LinkedIn or social account as a
  go-to-market channel — deciding what to post before they have case studies,
  finding the themes only they can own, building a post bank, and setting a
  cadence that survives a bad quarter. Also use when the user mentions founder-led
  content, personal brand, founder brand, LinkedIn strategy, posting as the
  founder, thought leadership, content cadence, ghostwriting a founder, or "what
  should I post". Produces a readiness verdict before the first post, three tested
  themes, a bank drafted from material the founder already owns, and a per-post
  check against the rules.

# Founder-Led Content

At Seed to Series B the founder is usually the only credible voice the company has. There is no
content team, no case studies, and no budget for a channel that takes a year to pay back. There is
one account buyers already trust more than the company page.

The work is not writing posts. It is deciding what the account is for, finding the three things only
this founder can say, building a bank before the first post goes out, and setting a floor that
survives the worst week of the quarter.

## When to use

The user is a founder about to start posting, has started and stalled, is asking what to post
without customer proof, or is deciding whether to hand the account to a ghostwriter.

Do not use this to write a week of generic posts on request. A founder account that could belong to
any founder in the category is the failure this skill exists to prevent.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first** (`.agents/product-marketing.md` / `.agents/aaj-brand.md`)
   for the buyer, the positioning and what the company can honestly claim.
2. **Get the one-line purpose:** *"I help [who] with [what problem]."* Every post is judged against
   that sentence. Without it there is no way to tell a good post from a popular one.
3. **Get the raw material,** in the founder's own words: what they have seen repeatedly across
   customer calls and lost deals, what they believe that their category does not, and what they have
   done first-hand. This is the only input that cannot be substituted.
4. **Get the worst-week cadence,** not the ambitious one.

## Method

The account works because buyers trust a person with a name more than a logo. It fails when it turns
into a diary or an advert. Its job is narrow: make the founder the person a buyer thinks of when the
problem comes up.

Two tests do most of the work.

**The competitor test.** Could a competitor's founder post this unchanged? If yes, it is not the
founder's material. Ownable content comes from three places, and only three:

| Source | What it is | Why it cannot be copied |
|---|---|---|
| **What you have seen** | The pattern across customer calls, lost deals, onboarding | Nobody else has that sample |
| **What you believe** | One position you would defend in a room of peers | It is a judgement, not a fact to look up |
| **What you have done** | A decision made, a number measured, a thing that failed | It happened to you |

**The proof test.** No case studies yet is the normal state, not a blocker. Five formats work without
a single customer logo: a decision explained, a mistake and its fix, a framework actually in use, a
buyer's question answered with identifying details removed, and a common claim corrected by tracing
it to source. What is never done is inventing the proof that does not exist yet.

## Workflow

1. **Write the one-line purpose.** Refuse to draft posts without it.
2. **Score the setup.** Run the engine. Report the verdict and every failed check verbatim. A "Not
   ready to post" is more useful than an encouraging number.
3. **Find the themes.** Draw candidates only from the three sources above, then run each through the
   competitor test. Keep exactly three. Three themes make a founder known for something; ten make
   them known for nothing.
4. **Fix the profile,** because every good post sends people there. Headline says who they help, not
   their job title. Featured section holds one thing a buyer can use today — a guide, a tool, a
   template. Never a sales page.
5. **Build the bank before the first post.** The founder already owns the material: articles,
   proposals, sales decks, answers typed into email three times. Cut each source three ways — a
   single sharp claim, a short list, a story with one lesson. Check the bank for repeats before
   scheduling; two drafts making the same point is the common failure.
6. **Draft for the feed.** First line carries the point, not the warm-up. One idea per post; a second
   idea is a second post. Run `checkPost` on every draft.
7. **Set the floor, not the target.** The lowest number sustainable in the worst week — for most
   founders, two a week. Batch the writing into one session. In a heavy quarter, post from the bank
   and write nothing new.
8. **Work the other half of the channel.** Comment on what the buyers already read, with something
   that adds to the argument. Reply to everyone who comments. Most results arrive privately, so add
   "How did you hear about us?" as an open text field on every intake form and ask it on every first
   call.
9. **Judge at ninety days,** on conversations started, self-reported source, and whether new
   followers match the buyer in the Step 1 sentence. Not impressions.
10. **Know when it stops being just the founder.** Three signals: they cannot hold the floor for a
    month; inbound questions need answers they should not be the one giving; or someone on the team
    has earned a point of view buyers would want. Then add a voice rather than replacing theirs.

## Run the tool

```
node resources/founder-channel.js --demo
```

`scoreSetup(setup)` returns a score, a verdict, every check with its reason, and what is missing
before the first post. `checkPost(post)` applies the drafting rules to a single draft: first line,
one idea, sourced figures, engagement bait, unpermitted customer results, and whether it sits inside
one of the three themes.

Use the engine's output rather than your own read of a draft — it is the same rubric every time,
which is the point.

## Present the result

1. **The one-line purpose**, as the founder wrote it.
2. **The setup verdict and score**, blockers first, each failed check with its reason.
3. **The three themes**, with the source of each and the competitor-test result.
4. **The bank**, with any repeats flagged.
5. **The drafts**, each with its check output beneath it.
6. **The floor cadence**, and the three numbers to judge at ninety days.

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Never invent proof.** No composite customers, no rounded-up results, no quote a client did not
  give in writing. One made-up detail costs more trust than a year of good posts earns.
- **Never write a figure without its source in the post.** A borrowed number is how a founder ends up
  correcting themselves in public.
- **No customer result without written permission** — no logos, no numbers, no name.
- **Write in the founder's voice, not a template's.** If the draft could be any founder's, it has
  failed the competitor test regardless of its score.
- **Reach is not the goal.** A post that travels outside the buyer's world brings followers who will
  never buy.
- **Do not build a cadence for the best week.** It collapses in the worst one and the silence shows.
- **Sell rarely, and say plainly when you are.** Buyers forgive an honest pitch far more readily than
  a disguised one.
- **Do not hand the account over early.** A ghostwriter can draft, edit and schedule; they cannot
  supply what the founder has seen or believes. Ideas and final approval stay with the founder, and
  they get the voice rules in writing.
- **Platform rules are hypotheses.** Claims about what the algorithm rewards get tested on this
  account for a month and kept only if the founder's own numbers support them.
