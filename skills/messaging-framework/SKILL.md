  Use when the user wants to build a messaging framework or message hierarchy —
  the organized set of what to say, to whom, and in what order. Also use when
  the user mentions messaging, message hierarchy, messaging pillars, core
  message, talking points, message map, value pillars, or "what should our
  messaging be." Produces a messaging framework — one core message, 3–4 pillars
  with proof, audience variants, and what to keep off-message.

# Messaging Framework

Organize everything you say into one core message and a few proof-backed pillars — so the whole team tells the same story, in the buyer's language.

## When to use

When messaging is inconsistent across the site, deck, and sales calls; when there's a value prop but no structure beneath it; or when a launch, rebrand, or new segment needs a message map the team can work from.

## Before you start

1. **Read the brand/product context first.** Pull the positioning, value proposition, ICP/segments, differentiator, proof, and voice from `.agents/product-marketing.md`. If the positioning or value prop is a gap, close it first.
2. **Gather inputs:** the segments that need their own emphasis.
3. **Confirm the objective:** a message map the team works from. (If positioning isn't settled, run `positioning-statement`; if the user just needs the hero line, use `value-proposition`.)

## Method

The framework organizes positioning and the value prop into one core message and a few pillars — it doesn't reinvent them. Every pillar carries proof; a pillar without proof is just a claim. Variants keep the same pillars but shift emphasis and language by audience. If there are two "core" messages, you don't have one yet.

## Workflow

1. **Start from positioning and the value prop.**
2. **Write one core message** — the single thing every buyer should believe.
3. **Build 3–4 pillars** — the few themes that support it.
4. **Back each pillar with proof** — a metric, an outcome, a mechanism.
5. **Write the "say this" lines** for each pillar, in the brand's voice.
6. **Create audience variants** and define off-message, then present.

## Reference

This skill bundles no data files. Pull positioning, value prop, proof, segments, and voice from `.agents/product-marketing.md`.

## Present the result

- **Core message** — one sentence.
- **Pillars (3–4)** — each with: the claim, the proof behind it, and 1–2 "say this" lines.
- **Audience variants** — the emphasis/language shift per segment.
- **Off-message** — what *not* to say (claims you can't back, or that blur the positioning).

## Guardrails & common mistakes

- **Exactly one core message.** Two means you haven't chosen; the story won't land.
- **Every pillar needs proof.** Claims without evidence read as marketing noise.
- **Use the buyer's language.** Internal jargon in the pillars means the buyer won't recognize themselves.
- **Pass the competitor test.** If a rival could claim the same set of pillars, sharpen them.
